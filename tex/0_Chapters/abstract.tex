Differential Equations commonly appear in most science and engineering domains. Although analytical solutions to these problems may exist, they are often complicated and can only be determined for fairly simple problems. Furthermore, to model real world engineering problems with sufficient accuracy, differential equations from multiple scientific domains are coupled and solved simultaneously. In such cases, it is almost impossible to analytically solve these differential equations (e.g. Navier-Stokes Equations). However, using numerical techniques, approximate solutions that satisfy the differential equations along with the prescribed boundary and initial conditions could be found. Thus, in the recent past, due to the rise and widespread availability of powerful computing resources, numerical approximations to differential equations have become the preferred way forward.

Numerical time-integration schemes are commonly used for solving initial value problems. Most engineering solver codes already implement these schemes in an efficient manner. However, the aim of this document is to explore and understand time-integration schemes and their algorithms that are already available in literature. Furthermore, a reference implementation of these algorithms in a programming language is sought after. Finally, an attempt is made to apply these algorithms to solve the equations of motion for mechanical systems.
